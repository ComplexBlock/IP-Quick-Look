# IP-Quick-Look
"IP Quick Look" is a automated network scanner that allows you to scan a specified range of ports on a target IP address and detect the operating system of the target machine. It uses multithreading to speed up the port scanning process and provides a simple but effective way to identify potential vulnerabilities in a network and determine the type of system running on the target machine.
